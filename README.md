# RP6502 Game Demo for LLVM-MOS

Get started by using the vscode-llvm-mos template from https://github.com/picocomputer/vscode-llvm-mos.  Find the "Use this template" button and follow the instructions to create a new repository.  

Once you have your respository set up, we are going to update CMakeLists.txt to build the demo game.  Update the contents of CMakeLists.txt to have the name of the game you want to make.  In this example, we are going to make a game called RPDemo.  The CMakeLists.txt file should look something like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

add_subdirectory(tools)

set(LLVM_MOS_PLATFORM rp6502)
find_package(llvm-mos-sdk REQUIRED)

project(RPDemo C CXX ASM)

add_executable(RPDemo)

rp6502_asset(RPDemo help src/help.txt)

rp6502_executable(RPDemo 
    DATA file 
    RESET file
)

target_sources(RPDemo PRIVATE
    src/main.c
)
```

At this point, you should be able to build the project in VScode with the build button and run it on your Picocomputer via F5 or the run button.  You can also run it from the command line with the following command:
```
python3 ./tools/rp6502.py run build/RPDemo.rp6502
```
[Note: If you are on a Mac, you can use rp6502_mac.py found in the tools directory of this repository.]

## Setting up Graphics

The documentation for the Picocomputer is excellent:
https://picocomputer.github.io

For this demo we are going to work with a 320x240 canvas.   Let's start by initializing the graphics system.  We can do this by calling the xreg_vga_canvas function with a parameter of 1.  Add the following to your main.c file, as well as ```#include <stdbool.h>``` at the top of the file:


```c
static bool init_graphics(void)
{
    // 320×240 canvas
    int rc;
    rc = xreg_vga_canvas(1);
    if (rc < 0) {
        puts("Error: xreg_vga_canvas(1) failed");
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

and then we will call this function from our main, and also set up a vsync loop to keep the program running.  Update your main function to look like this:

```c

uint8_t vsync_last = 0;

int main(void)
{
    if (!init_graphics()) {
        puts("Fatal: graphics initialization failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Main loop
    while (true) {
        // 1. SYNC
        if (RIA.vsync == vsync_last) continue;
        vsync_last = RIA.vsync;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

If you build and run this code, you should see a blank screen on your Picocomputer.  This means that we have successfully initialized the graphics system and are running a main loop that is synced to the vertical refresh of the display.  In the next section, we will start drawing some pixels to the screen!  To exit the program hit "CTRL + ALT + DEL" on the keyboard connected to your Picocomputer.

## Adding a Sprite

We are going to use Mode 5 Sprite system for the demo.  It's very flexible and powerful.  We are going to add a 4-bpp (16-colour) sprite with a custom palette and start to get a feel for the XRAM system.   The images folder contains "Player_4bpp.bin" which is a 16x16 pixel sprite in the 4-bpp format.  We will learn later how to make our own sprites and convert them to the correct format.  

We are going to load this sprite into XRAM and then draw it to the screen.  First, we need to add the sprite as an asset in our CMakeLists.txt file.  Update your CMakeLists.txt to add a new rp6502_asset for the sprite, and make sure to include the correct path to the image file.  Your CMakeLists.txt should now look like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)

add_subdirectory(tools)

set(LLVM_MOS_PLATFORM rp6502)
find_package(llvm-mos-sdk REQUIRED)

project(RPDemo C CXX ASM)

add_executable(RPDemo)

rp6502_asset(RPDemo 0x10000 images/Player_4bpp.bin)
rp6502_asset(RPDemo help src/help.txt)

rp6502_executable(RPDemo 
    DATA file 
    RESET file
)

target_sources(RPDemo PRIVATE
    src/main.c
)
```

This will place the sprite in XRAM at address 0x10000.  I strongly recommend using a simple spreadsheet to track XRAM memory usage.  You can use my template if you like:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLckfGkOWBRM4_hf3JohAPjYF4lZ37s38hei422bUt4/edit?usp=sharing

I personally like to track assets using a ```constants.h``` file.  

```c
#ifndef CONSTANTS_H
#define CONSTANTS_H

// Screen dimensions
#define SCREEN_WIDTH 320
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 240

// Sprite data configuration
#define SPRITE_DATA_START       0x0000U            // Starting address in XRAM for sprite data

#define PLAYER_DATA            (SPRITE_DATA_START) // Address for main tile bitmap data
#define PLAYER_DATA_SIZE        0x0080U            // 128 bytes (16x16 at 4bpp)
#define PLAYER_SPRITE_SIZE_PX   16                 // Player sprite is 16x16 pixels

#define SPRITE_DATA_END        (PLAYER_DATA + PLAYER_DATA_SIZE) // End address for sprite data

// Palette configurations
#define PLAYER_PALETTE_ADDR    0xFC00  // 16-color palette (32 bytes, 0xFC00-0xFC1F)
#define PLAYER_PALETTE_SIZE    0x0020

#endif // CONSTANTS_H
```

This file defines some constants for our game, including the screen dimensions and the memory layout for our sprite data.  We have defined a section of XRAM starting at 0x0000 for our sprite data, and we have allocated 128 bytes for our player sprite, which is a 16x16 pixel sprite at 4 bits per pixel (4bpp).  This means that each pixel takes up 4 bits, so we can fit two pixels in one byte.  Therefore, a 16x16 sprite will require 128 bytes of memory (16 * 16 * 4 bits / 8 bits per byte = 128 bytes).  If you use the Spreadsheet all the Hex math is done for you.  

Now let's create ```sprite_mode5.c``` and ````sprite_mode5.h```` files to handle the sprite drawing logic.  In these files, we will write functions to initialize the sprite system, load our sprite data into XRAM, and draw the sprite to the screen.  This will help us keep our main.c file clean and organized.  Here is an example of what the contents of these files might look like:

```c
#include <rp6502.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include "constants.h"
#include "sprite_mode5.h"

// Store the player config address for updates
unsigned PLAYER_CONFIG;

void sprite_mode5_init(void) {
    int rc;
    int16_t center_x = (int16_t)((SCREEN_WIDTH - PLAYER_SPRITE_SIZE_PX) / 2);
    int16_t center_y = (int16_t)((SCREEN_HEIGHT - PLAYER_SPRITE_SIZE_PX) * 2 / 3); // Start slightly lower than center for better composition

    PLAYER_CONFIG = SPRITE_DATA_END; // Just after the end of sprite data

    xram0_struct_set(PLAYER_CONFIG, vga_mode5_sprite_t, x_pos_px, center_x);
    xram0_struct_set(PLAYER_CONFIG, vga_mode5_sprite_t, y_pos_px, center_y);
    xram0_struct_set(PLAYER_CONFIG, vga_mode5_sprite_t, xram_sprite_ptr, PLAYER_DATA);
    xram0_struct_set(PLAYER_CONFIG, vga_mode5_sprite_t, palette_ptr, PLAYER_PALETTE_ADDR);


    // Mode 5 args: MODE, OPTIONS, CONFIG, LENGTH, PLANE, BEGIN, END
    if (xreg_vga_mode(5, 0x0A, PLAYER_CONFIG, 1, 1, 0, 0) < 0) {
        puts("xreg_vga_mode failed");
        return;
    }


    RIA.addr0 = PLAYER_PALETTE_ADDR;
    RIA.step0 = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        RIA.rw0 = player_palette[i] & 0xFF;
        RIA.rw0 = player_palette[i] >> 8;
    }


    puts("Mode5 player sprite ready");
}
```

```c
#ifndef SPRITE_MODE5_H
#define SPRITE_MODE5_H

typedef struct {
    int16_t x_pos_px;
    int16_t y_pos_px;
    uint16_t xram_sprite_ptr;
    uint16_t palette_ptr;
} vga_mode5_sprite_t;

// Palette extracted from Sprites/Player.png
static const uint16_t player_palette[16] = {
    0x0000, // transparent
    0xA820,
    0x0560,
    0xAD60,
    0x0035,
    0xA835,
    0x02B5,
    0xAD75,
    0x52AA,
    0xFAAA,
    0x57EA,
    0xFFEA,
    0x52BF,
    0xFABF,
    0x57FF,
    0xFFFF,
};

void sprite_mode5_init(void);

#endif // SPRITE_MODE5_H
```

Update CMakeLists.txt to include the new source file:

```cmake
target_sources(RPDemo PRIVATE
    src/main.c
    src/sprite_mode5.c
)
```

and update main.c to look like this:

```c
#include <rp6502.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "constants.h"
#include "sprite_mode5.h"



static bool init_graphics(void)
{
    // 320×240 canvas
    int rc;
    rc = xreg_vga_canvas(1);
    if (rc < 0) {
        puts("Error: xreg_vga_canvas(1) failed");
        return false;
    }

    sprite_mode5_init();

    return true;
}

uint8_t vsync_last = 0;

int main(void)
{
    if (!init_graphics()) {
        puts("Fatal: graphics initialization failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Main loop
    while (true) {
        // 1. SYNC
        if (RIA.vsync == vsync_last) continue;
        vsync_last = RIA.vsync;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
